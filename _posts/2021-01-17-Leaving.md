Hello dear!  
It's a long time we were together,  
Can you remember the dusk?  
We were high and happy together,  
Watching sunset in the midst of the city.  

My friend,  
Do you remember the warm winter day?  
Listening to the spring song in the woods,  
Watching squirrel play and drinking tea.  
We found our spring on that day!  

O dear!  
We know it's hard to leave,  
But, leaving is not that bad my friend.  
Cause you only need the light when it's burning low,  
Only know you love me when you let me go.  

But dear!  
Everything has an end,  
Neither the winter nor my leaving will be forever.  
We will meet again and watch sunset together,  
In the midst of this chaotic city.
