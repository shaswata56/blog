This is my first blog post. I've never wished to write a blog, but now I do. Lots of changes are happening around me, everywhere, every country, every place, every time. This global pandemic showed me that my expectation from humanity is totally bullshit. It's true we're sending more satellites to orbit, but actually we're no better than monkeys and sometimes worse.
